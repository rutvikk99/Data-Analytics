1.repetition by application Learn by doing
2.spaced learning so study less 2hr coding session every morning instead of 8 hr continuous
3.Don't be too hard stop watching tutorial only for advanced 
you can watch it rest learn all the basics by yourself
4.surround yourself with like minded people join discord slack etc
5.utility based learning :- learn basics and skip advanced 
don't try to learn anything

Fastest way to learn web development 
1.front end - html css js -stuck in basics evven worse 60 hrs of tutorial 
spend minimun amount of time watching and maximum amount of time doing
w3 schools 
html -go till graphics
css - go till grid

4.linkedin clone -clever qazi
5.portfolio website 
6.projects like clone to do web app 
7.backend -nodejs -express 
8.database - sql and nosql -mongodb
learn by building look docs and lookup online 
9.build fullstack clone
10.add backend on front end apps
11.interviews

How I would learn to code
pick one language and master it 
learn by doing stop watching tutorial
build guided projects and documentation
build your own projects
learn ds & Algo

sahil gaba -power couple
how youtube ruined my career
there is no shortcut to success in coding
do exercises stop videos 
web development is broad and takes to much time
master one language as a begineer
it takes a lot of time to become good coder 
skip short time videos 
and don't watch 10+hrs video it is waste of time 
you want retain much information don't try to learn everything 
make sure basics is done correctly 
learn debuging
dunning kruger effect 
you ll always face roadblocks 
have support system
solid understanding of algorithms and data structure 


smart work --know what to use and how to use
leetcodes



prep for interview 
self belief keep applying u ll have 100s of rejection until you get
good job
