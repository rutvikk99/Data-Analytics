codewars 
start with easy problems 
think about problem -
break it down in smaller steps 
think in smaller solutions and build up bit by bit
write pseudo code and think in pen paper first 
mistake newbies make 
test every single line by printing it 
then debugging 
look at documentation by googling
limit to 10 minute per problem and
 look at the solution and reerverse engineer the problem and 
think what part is separating from your solution
create mental link between your ans and solution and try to write the answer again 
Reset the solution and try to rebuild it after 2 to 3 days and 
check if you have learned it or not 
 
RECAP
think problem as i/p to o/p
ask how ?
go to docs 
test each line
do this for many problems
